                                - Given a set of training features and their corresponding labels the idea is to label a 
                                new unlabelled feature based on its attributes with respect to the attributes of the
                                training features. This is like labeling a person as "bad" or "good" based on her/his
                                behavior and our prejudice of how a "good" or "bad" person should behave.

                                There are different methods to separate one class with another ( binary classification )
                                following the notions of a SVM. Two of the simplest, but not for that less effectives or
                                efficients, are PEGASOS and the Dual Coordinate Descent approach respectively.
                                Both are described in these links:
