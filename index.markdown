The main purpose of this site is to storage information on everything related with the Machine Learning topic. This information is given as guides trying to show how a determined Machine learning algorithm works, with the most effective learning method: with examples. This is because sometimes is hard to find an algorithm implementation as a numeric expression, that is, using actual numbers.

Evidently, the content on this site is not academic source, only collects information from other reliable sources and tries to simplifies it.
